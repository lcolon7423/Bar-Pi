# Bar-Pi
Raspberry pi Database Smart bartender using Python and Flask with Bootstrap 4.5

Note: This is my first attempt sharing my ideas online. And this project, like life, nothing stays the same. With the help of community as well as the people around me I will continue to recode, reconfigure and redesign all the projects that I create, and come up with a different ways of how to do and see things. If you are reading this, I hope that this inspires you to know that what is, doesn't have to be.

It could be more.

This project was inspired first by Bar2d2 (https://www.instructables.com/Build-A-Mobile-Bar-BaR2D2/).

Then later on the Hacker Shack verison (https://www.hackster.io/hackershack/smart-bartender-5c430e)

My main focus on this project was the software (which is something that I also need to work on) not the hardware which explains the unfinished look of the Bar-Pi. It was meant to be a prototype, not the finished product, and I didn't have the time to make it look cooler. I've been working on this on and off (mostly off) for the last 3 years. and I felt getting a working verison as far as software was more important to me than how it looks.

Now with that being said, if there is an interest for a better design, I will be willing to build one step by step from scratch. Like I said before, nothing stays the same and there is no project of mine that will ever truly be finished. Just upgraded.
